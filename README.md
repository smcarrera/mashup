SMCARRERA Mashup Project
Uses data from 2 APIs: Instragram & Weather Underground (WU)
The Site shows the 16 most recent images on Instagram tagged as #brooklyn Brdige
and the current weather temperature and weather conditions at the brooklyn bridge from WU.
The background image then changes based on the current weather conditions and time of day.

V1: was instagram only
V2: Added Weather Undergound + improvements

# Mashup project

This project is open-ended!  Requirements:

* Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting, interactive way.
* Replace this README with a description of the project.
* You are welcome to use any 3rd-party libraries/frameworks â€“ just load them from a CDN (e.g. [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com)), or put them under the [`vendor/`](vendor/) folder.

The JS code should be **non-trivial**.  That being said... start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.

* [AJAX demos](https://github.com/advanced-js/deck/tree/gh-pages/demos/ajax)
* [list of API suggestions](https://gist.github.com/afeld/4952991)
* [inspiration?](http://www.programmableweb.com/mashups)

## V1

First pass.

## V2

Iterate!

* Refactor
* Add a new feature

## Bonus points

* automated tests
    * [Sinon.js fakeServer](http://sinonjs.org/docs/#fakeServer) may be helpful
* fancy interactivity/animations
